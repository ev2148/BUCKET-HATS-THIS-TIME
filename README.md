# BUCKET-HATS-THIS-TIME

Documentation:

Project Name: Bucket Hats™ 
Project Description: The objective of the project was to create a page for my business, Bucket Hats™, and for it to be similar to an e-commerce website. But rather than having it fully be an e-commerce website, I wanted it to be more blog-style and casual looking. The website itself is pretty simple, but I strived to create an enticing page that made bucket hats seem cooler than they actually are so that customers are inclined to purchase.  
Process: I tried to mimic the design of popular online shops and business websites, and I did my best to follow modern-looking themes that appeal to younger users. 
Reflection/Evaluation: The process of coding this website was extremely difficult for me, especially towards the beginning when everything was very new and overwhelming.  I struggled to figure out the basics and pick up on patterns. I did not have high expectations as I have been struggling with anything related to tech for years, and my biggest goal for this project was to simply be able to create something. After much trial and error, I eventually started to get a sense of patterns and structure and the process started to become quicker. The site is not perfect by any means but I think I was able to get the point across fairly well through layout and design.
